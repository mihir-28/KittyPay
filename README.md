## üì± Progressive Web App Features

KittyPay is a Progressive Web App (PWA) which means you can:

- Install it on your home screen for a native app-like experience
- Use it offline with full functionality thanks to service worker caching
- Receive notifications about new content updates
- Enjoy fast loading times with optimized asset caching
- Sync data when back online after being offline

### PWA Installation

On supported browsers (Chrome, Edge, Safari on iOS, etc.):

1. Visit the KittyPay website
2. You'll see an "Install App" button in the bottom left corner
3. Click it to install KittyPay as a standalone app
4. Alternatively, use your browser's built-in "Add to Home Screen" or "Install" option

### Offline Support

KittyPay works offline thanks to service worker caching:

- Core app files are cached for instant loading
- Your kitties and expenses data is stored locally when offline
- When you're back online, data is automatically synced with the server
- You'll receive a notification when new content is available

### Testing PWA Features

In development mode, you can test PWA functionality by running:
```js
// In your browser console
window.runPWATests()
```

This will check service worker registration, cache status, and offline capabilities.
